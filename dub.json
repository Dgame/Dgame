#What is Dgame?
Dgame is a 2D framework which is based on the SDL and OpenGL, and is designed for the D programming language.
The design rests upon Pygame and as well on the SFML from the C++ programming language.
#Why Dgame?
Currently D has only few frameworks for games and window programming, and most of them are C/C++ bindings.
Of those Derelict is probaly the most famous and provides support for multiple C/C++ libraries.
Dgame also uses Derelict to access the functionality of the SDL and OpenGL.
However, unlike the other bindings, Dgame is object-oriented (like the SFML)
and is the only one which is completely written in D.
